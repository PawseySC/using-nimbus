## What are Security Groups?

**Security Groups** are the tool you use to protect access to your instance.  Remember that in order to gain access you will use SSH (Secure-Shell).

SSH is an encrypted network protocol which connects over port 22, so your **Security Groups** must allow for at least these connections.

The "port" mentioned here is a number used by the system to define a network communication protocol.  HTTP, which you may be familiar with, normally uses port 80.

## Less is better

Each port you open on an instance is a potential vulnerability, so we strongly recommend you limit open ports to those strictly necessary for your work.

## How do you make new groups and rules?

To make a security group, go to the Network / Security Groups section and click **Create Security Group**:

![Manage Security Groups]({{ page.root }}/fig/Nimbus_Security_Groups.png)


Give your security group a name:

![Create Security Groups]({{ page.root }}/fig/Nimbus_create_Security_Groups.png)

In this case we will be creating a rule to allow web access using the HTTP protocol, so call it http or web access. Once you've given a name you are returned to the security group management pane. Now if you click the pull-down menu for the http group you'll see two options - Edit Security Group, or Delete Security Group.

![Create Security Groups]({{ page.root }}/fig/Manage_http.png)

We haven't set any rules yet, so instead click on the Manage rules button to be able to set some for the http group.

![Manage Security Groups Rules]({{ page.root }}/fig/Rules_http.png)

You'll notice it has two rules already, both in the **Egress** direction, meaning connections can go out from your instance. We need to add rules to allow connections to your instance from outside using the HTTP protocol.

When creating rules you have two options, you can create a custom rule:

![ Security Group Add Rule]({{ page.root }}/fig/Nimbus_Security_add_rule.png)

Or you can select a rule from the predefined list:

![ Security Group Add Rule List]({{ page.root }}/fig/Nimbus_Security_add_rule_options.png)

You'll notice there is a predefined HTTP rule, so go ahead and select that. When you return to the http rules page you'll notice it now has an extra rule, an **Ingress** on port 80. You have now created a security group for HTTP and could use your instance as a webserver for example.
