  <li>
    <p><strong>Snapshot your instance!</strong></p>

    <p>This saves your Root Disk and allows you to launch a fully configured instance with all packages already installed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Document your steps so you know what you did</strong></p>

    <p>Create a configuration script, save a copy out of the cloud and keep it up to date
 history -&gt; prints all previous commands
 history  |  keyword -&gt; searches a specific command</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Update! Every time you login!</strong></p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get update</code>-&gt; updates packages and security
 Older versions of packages and operating systems eventually lose support from their creators</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be Green and keep it elastic</strong></p>

    <p>The cloud still uses electricity and is shared, when you’re no longer using it -&gt; turn it off!</p>

<h2 id="ideas-for-using-your-vm">Ideas for using your VM</h2>
<p>Once you have your shiny new VM, you are now the master of your own destiny.  You have flexibility to download software to start doing science.  Listed below are some tips on installing some common software packages that you might like to use however “Googling” your linux flavour / version along with the software will often give you success.  Also listed as details on moving data to your instance</p>

<p><strong>Conda</strong></p>

<p>Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system.   that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs but it can package and distribute software for any language.</p>

<p>You can get started by downloading the installer suitable for your instance.  Miniconda installer page is given here <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a></p>
