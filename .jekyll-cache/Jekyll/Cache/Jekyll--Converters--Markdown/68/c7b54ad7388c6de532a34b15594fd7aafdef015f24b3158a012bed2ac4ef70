<p>Unlike on your laptop or desktop computer, you interact with your Nimbus instance remotely using the command line, ie. via a terminal. This means managing software is also done via the terminal, which might be an unfamiliar experience for many. In this episode we cover some of the basics youâ€™ll need to manage software on your instances via the command line interface.</p>

<p>There are many types and flavours of Linux distribution. The most widely used are often the Debian based linux distributions such as Ubuntu, and the Red Hat/Fedora based distribution such as CentOS. Other distributions have different methods to do updates that will not be covered for the purpose of this training.</p>

<p>All modern Linux distribution do not allow the superuser (root) to connect directly to perform administrative tasks. What is used is a â€œserviceâ€ user that does not have administrative permissions, but that can access those privileges by executing the command â€œsudoâ€ before administrative like commands.</p>

<h2 id="use-these-commands-as-often-as-possible">Use these commands as often as possible!</h2>

<p>Ideally, combine these commands, depending on your Linux distribution, and run them at least once a week, or every time you login.</p>

<p>This will keep your instance up to date.</p>

<h2 id="package-managers">Package managers</h2>

<p>Package managers are a collection of software tools that automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computerâ€™s operating system in a consistent manner.</p>

<p>Package managers are designed to eliminate the need for manual installs and updates. There are a range of different package managers available for different operating systems, as well as those for specific languages that work across different systems, such as the conda package manager for Python.</p>

<p>To install new software on Ubuntu you use apt:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudoÂ  apt-getÂ  install &lt;package_name&gt;</code></td>
      <td>Install packages available within your selected Linux distributionâ€™s software package repository</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>To install new software on CentOS you use yum:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudoÂ  yum install &lt;package_name&gt;</code></td>
      <td>Install packages available within your selected Linux distributionâ€™s software package repository</td>
    </tr>
