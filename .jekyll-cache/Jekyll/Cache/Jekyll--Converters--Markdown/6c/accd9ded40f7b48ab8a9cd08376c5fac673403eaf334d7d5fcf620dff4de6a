I"#<p>To maintain a secure system, we require all Nimbus users to have a key pair. Key pairs take the form of public (think: ‘lock’) and private (think: ‘key’) key files.  These files are presented together to securely authenticate (login) to a Nimbus instance. Without a key pair you cannot access your instance, as the username/password login option is disabled by default.</p>

<blockquote class="keypoints">
  <h2 id="secure-access">Secure access</h2>
  <p>The username/password login is not set up for new instances, as it is a less secure method of authentication than key pairs. <em>Question: Why are key pairs more secure than username and password?</em></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log in to the Nimbus dashboard and navigate to the <strong>Key Pairs</strong> panel under the <strong>Compute</strong> menu.</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Create Key Pair</strong> button. The <strong>Create Key Pair</strong> dialog box will appear.</li>
    <li>Enter a name - this can be anything, but try to make it meaningful - then click the <strong>Create Keypair</strong> button.  The dialog box will close and your browser will download the private key file with the name you gave it and a .pem extension, for eg <code class="highlighter-rouge">my_first_key.pem</code>. Make sure to save your private key file somewhere safe so you can access it later.</li>
  </ol>
