I"ö<p>This episode will step you through the process of launching an instance on Nimbus.  You will be making decisions on the specifications of your instance.  When you are doing this for the first time it can seem like a lot of information to take in before you can start an instance. As you become more familiar with this process it will become less intimidating.</p>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="activity-create-an-instance">Activity: Create an Instance</h2>
  <h3 id="1-start-the-process">1. Start the process</h3>

  <p>Login to the Nimbus dashboard. From the left hand menu select <strong>Compute</strong> then <strong>Instances</strong>. Click on the <strong>Launch Instance</strong> button.</p>

  <p><kbd><img src="../fig/Create_instance_button.png" /></kbd></p>

  <h3 id="2-choose-a-name">2. Choose a Name</h3>

  <p>Clicking on <strong>Lauch Instance</strong> brings up the <strong>Launch Instance</strong> window. Configuration options are listed by topic in the menu on the left. These can be progressed through sequentially via the navigation buttons on the bottom right, or can be selected by clicking directly on the desired topic. The initial step is to give your instance a name.  It doesnâ€™t matter what you call it; usually we recommend giving your instance a name related to the task it will be performing.
Then click <strong>next</strong>.</p>

  <h3 id="3-choose-a-source-image">3. Choose a source image</h3>

  <p>The selection of the Source Image defines the operating system that will be used to launch your instance.  We include some images directly from upstream providers, as well as curating some of our own (marked with Pawsey in the name).</p>

  <p><strong>NB:</strong> Selecting a GPU image will not allocate you a GPU :)</p>

  <p>Make sure that Boot Source is set to <strong>Image</strong>, set <strong>Volume Size</strong> to 10GB, and <strong>Delete Volume on Instance Delete</strong> should be set to Yes.
<br />

<br />
For training purposes we will be using the Pawsey Ubuntu 18.04 image. Click the up-arrow to the right of the image name so that it is listed under <strong>allocated</strong> as shown below. Then click <strong>Next</strong>.<br />

<br /><br /></p>
  <h3 id="4-select-a-flavor">4. Select a flavor</h3>

  <p>A â€˜flavourâ€™ (or â€˜flavorâ€™ because our software prefers US spelling) defines the characteristics of an instance.  We provide a range of flavours that vary based on the number of cores available to your instance.</p>

  <p>If youâ€™re at a training event, then select <strong>m2.small</strong>.  If youâ€™re self-learning, choose any flavour that you wish.</p>

  <p><kbd><img src="../fig/Instance_flavour.png" /></kbd></p>

  <h3 id="5-select-a-network">5. Select a network</h3>

  <p>The <strong>Networks</strong> tab is where you will define the networking available to your instance.</p>

  <p>Nimbus projects have networking prepared for you.  Using a training account you will see a network named something like  <strong>cou010-network</strong>.  If you are using your own project you will see a network name similar to this.</p>

  <p>You will also see a <strong>Public external</strong> network.  We will use this now since you get a public IP address automatically.</p>

  <p><kbd><img src="../fig/Instance_network.png" /></kbd></p>

  <h3 id="6-check-security-groups">6. Check security groups</h3>

  <p>We skip over <strong>Network Ports</strong> at this stage, as they are only for more advanced use of an instance. Instead go straight to <strong>Security Groups</strong>.</p>

  <p>The security group called <strong>default</strong> is selected already, and you should leave it like that.  It allows outgoing connections from your instance, and communication between your instances if you need more than one.</p>

  <p>Nimbus projects are preconfigured with a security group to permit incoming SSH access.  This is required by most users.  The security group to add is named something like <strong>cou010-SSH</strong>.</p>

  <p><kbd><img src="../fig/Instance_security.png" /></kbd></p>

  <h3 id="7-select-a-keypair">7. Select a keypair</h3>

  <p><kbd><img src="../fig/Instance_keypairs.png" /></kbd></p>

  <h3 id="8-launch-instance">8. Launch instance</h3>

  <p>When you click <strong>Launch Instance</strong> you should see a new instance show up in your list (probably the only item you see listed).  You will see it change state as it starts up.</p>

  <p><kbd><img src="../fig/Launch_instance_click.png" /></kbd></p>

  <p>When complete, your entry should look something like this:</p>

  <h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
  <p>It is easy to forget a step or misconfigure required elements.  The result may be errors on starting the instance, or you may be unable to connect once the instance is up and running. Whether you are working through this in a class, or by yourself, we find that (usually) the easiest fix is to delete the instance and make a new one, paying close attention to each step.</p>

<blockquote class="checklist">
  <h2 id="what-did-we-do">What did we do?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Gave our instance a name</li>
    <li>Selected an operating system source image</li>
    <li>Provisioned our instance by selecting a flavor of memory, CPUs, and storage</li>
    <li>Gave our instance access to the outside world by selecting the public external network</li>
    <li>Selected a security group to allow SSH access</li>
    <li>Selected a key pair so we can login to our instance</li>
    <li>Created our instance</li>
  </ul>
