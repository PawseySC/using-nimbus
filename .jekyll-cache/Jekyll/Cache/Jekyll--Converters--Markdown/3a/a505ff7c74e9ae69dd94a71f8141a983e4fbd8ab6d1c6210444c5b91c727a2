I"<p>Like most other institutions globally, we’re using online as our main teaching mode. There are several good practices we’ll use during this training. We ask you to please:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Put yourself on mute to eliminate background noise.</li>
  <li>If you have a question:</li>
  <li>Place your question in the chat.</li>
  <li>Raise your hand virtually in the chat using “hand/” if you’d like to speak. (If small class)</li>
  <li>At the end of each episode, se will address posted questions.</li>
  <li>Be respectful of all participants through language choice and actions, both in the main room and breakout rooms.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="activity-zoom-features">Activity: Zoom features</h2>
  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>How many of you have used Zoom previously, for online training or meeting?  
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>To answer this question, raise your hand virtually. There are a few ways of doing this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the hand symbol in Zoom.</li>
    <li>Type ‘hand/’ in the chat window.</li>
    <li>Physically wave your hand in front of your video camera.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For this session, we request that you place your question in the chat window. We will address your posted questions as we go through each episode. We will open the floor for spoken questions at the end of the overall session; to ask a question, type ‘hand/’ in the chat window.</p>

<p>Now, a question. How many of you have used Zoom previously, for online training or meeting? Raise your hand in the chat if you have, by typing ‘hand/’.</p>

<p>In this session, we will not be using an external document.</p>

<p>We will use the features of Zoom to talk as a group in the main area, where we are now. And we’ll use Breakout rooms for small group discussions (if applicable).</p>

<p>We’ll use this Software Carpentry-esque document as our main document. You’ll have access to this training after the class.</p>

<p>Let’s get started!</p>
