<p>There are many types and flavours of Linux distribution. The most widely used are often the Debian based linux distributions such as Ubuntu, and the Red Hat/Fedora based distribution such as CentOS. Other distributions have different methods to do updates that will not be covered for the purpose of this training.</p>

<p>All modern Linux distribution do not allow the superuser (root) to connect directly to perform administrative task. What is used is a â€œserviceâ€ user that does not have administrative permissions, but that can access those privileges by executing the command â€œsudoâ€ before administrative like commands.</p>

<h2 id="use-these-commands-as-often-as-possible">Use these commands as often as possible!</h2>

<p>Ideally, combine these commands, depending on your Linux distribution, and run them at least once a week, or every time you login.</p>

<p>This will keep your instance up to date.</p>

    <p><strong>Snapshot your instance!</strong></p>

    <p>This saves your Root Disk and allows you to launch a fully configured instance with all packages already installed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Document your steps so you know what you did</strong></p>

    <p>Create a configuration script, save a copy out of the cloud and keep it up to date
 history -&gt; prints all previous commands
 history  |  keyword -&gt; searches a specific command</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Update! Every time you login!</strong></p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get update</code>-&gt; updates packages and security
 Older versions of packages and operating systems eventually lose support from their creators</p>

<h2 id="ideas-for-using-your-vm">Ideas for using your VM</h2>
<p>Once you have your shiny new VM, you are now the master of your own destiny.  You have flexibility to download software to start doing science.  Listed below are some tips on installing some common software packages that you might like to use however â€œGooglingâ€ your linux flavour / version along with the software will often give you success.  Also listed as details on moving data to your instance</p>

<p><strong>Conda</strong></p>

<p>Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system.   that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs but it can package and distribute software for any language.</p>

<p>You can get started by downloading the installer suitable for your instance.  Miniconda installer page is given here <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a></p>

<p>Further information on installation here <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html">Linux installation</a></p>

<p><strong>R</strong></p>

<p>You can install R or Rstudio easily for most Linux flavours</p>

<p>for Debian/Ubuntu run <em>sudo apt-get install r-base</em> and or Fedora run <em>sudo yum install R</em> then type <em>R</em> to run</p>

<p>RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that makes R easier to use.  Go to RStudio download page - <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/</a> and enter the following for Ubuntu</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>sudo apt-get install gdebi-core</em></li>
  <li><em>wget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/trusty/amd64/rstudio-server-1.2.1335-amd64.deb</em></li>
  <li><em>sudo gdebi rstudio-server-1.2.1335-amd64.deb</em></li>
</ul>
