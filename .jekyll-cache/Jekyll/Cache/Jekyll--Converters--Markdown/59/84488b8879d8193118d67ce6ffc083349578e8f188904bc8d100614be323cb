<h2 id="what-are-security-groups">What are Security Groups?</h2>

<p><strong>Security Groups</strong> are the tool you use to protect access to your instance.  Remember that in order to gain access you will use SSH (Secure-Shell).</p>

<p>SSH is an encrypted network protocol which connects over port 22, so your <strong>Security Groups</strong> must allow for at least these connections.</p>

<p>The “port” mentioned here is a number used by the system to define a network communication protocol.  HTTP, which you may be familiar with, normally uses port 80.</p>

<h2 id="less-is-better">Less is better</h2>

<p>Each port you open on an instance is a potential vulnerability, so we strongly recommend you limit open ports to those strictly necessary for your work.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-make-new-groups-and-rules">How do you make new groups and rules?</h2>

<p>To make a security group, go to the Network / Security Groups section and click <strong>Create Security Group</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="../fig/Nimbus_Security_Groups.png" alt="Manage Security Groups" /></p>

<p>Give your security group a name:</p>

<p><img src="../fig/Nimbus_create_Security_Groups.png" alt="Create Security Groups" /></p>

<p>In this case we will be creating a rule to allow web access using the HTTP protocol, so call it http or web access. Once you’ve given a name you are returned to the security group management pane. Now if you click the pull-down menu for the http group you’ll see two options - Edit Security Group, or Delete Security Group.</p>

<p><img src="../fig/Manage_http.png" alt="Create Security Groups" /></p>

<p>We haven’t set any rules yet, so instead click on the Manage rules button to be able to set some for the http group.  <strong>Ingress</strong> means connections can come in to your instance, and <strong>Egress</strong> means connections that can go out from your instance.</p>

<p><img src="../fig/Rules_http.png" alt="Manage Security Groups Rules" /></p>

<p>You can create a custom rule:</p>

<p><img src="../fig/Nimbus_Security_add_rule.png" alt=" Security Group Add Rule" /></p>

<p>Or you can select a rule from the predefined list</p>
