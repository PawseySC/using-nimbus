<p>A popular terminal client for Windows users is MobaXTerm, which includes an integrated X server
with SSH client to run any graphical applications.</p>

<p>You can download MobaXterm Home Edition from the following link:
http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html .</p>

<p>For the “installer edition” (recommended) you might need administration rights on your Windows OS.
Double-click the downloaded Microsoft Installer file (.msi), and the Windows wizard will automatically
guide you through the installation process. Also make sure to check whether Windows Firewall hasn’t blocked
any features of this program after installation.
If you do not have installation rights, you can try the “portable edition”.</p>
