I"Ô<p>This episode will step you through the process of launching an instance on Nimbus.  You will be making decisions on the specifications of your instance.  When you are doing this for the first time it can seem like a lot of information to take in before you can start an instance. As you become more familiar with this process it will become less intimidating.</p>

<blockquote class="keypoints">
  <h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
  <p>It is easy to forget a step or misconfigure required elements.  The result may be errors on starting the instance, or you may be unable to connect once the instance is up and running. Whether you are working through this in a class, or by yourself, we find that (usually) the easiest fix is to delete the instance and make a new one, paying close attention to each step.</p>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="activity-create-an-instance">Activity: Create an Instance</h2>
  <p>From the left hand menu select <strong>Compute</strong> then <strong>Instances</strong>. Click on the <strong>Launch Instance</strong> button.</p>

  <p><kbd><img src="../fig/Create_instance_button.png" /></kbd></p>

  <h3 id="1-set-a-name">1. Set a Name</h3>

  <p>The first step is to give your instance a name.  It doesnâ€™t matter what you call it; usually we recommend giving your instance a name related to the task it will be performing.</p>

  <p><kbd><img src="../fig/Launch_details.png" /></kbd></p>

  <h3 id="2-choose-a-source-image">2. Choose a source image</h3>

  <p>The selection of the Source Image defines the operating system that will be used to launch your instance.  We include some images directly from upstream providers, as well as curating some of our own (marked with Pawsey in the name).</p>

  <p><strong>NB</strong> Selecting a GPU image will not allocate you a GPU :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make sure that Boot Source is set to <strong>Image</strong>, and <strong>Delete Volume on Instance Delete</strong> should be set to Yes.</p>

<p>Click the up-arrow to the right of the image name so that it is listed under <strong>allocated</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="3-select-a-flavor">3. Select a flavor</h2>

<p>A â€˜flavourâ€™ (or â€˜flavorâ€™ because our software prefers US spelling) defines the characteristics of an instance.  We provide a range of flavours that vary based on the number of cores available to your instance.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re at a training event, then select <strong>m2.small</strong>.  If youâ€™re self-learning, choose any flavour that you wish.</p>

<h2 id="4-select-a-network">4. Select a network</h2>

<p>The <strong>Networks</strong> tab is where you will define the networking available to your instance.</p>

<p>Nimbus projects have networking prepared for you.  Using a training account you will see a network named something like <strong>cou010-network</strong>.  If you are using your own project you will see a network name similar to this.</p>

<p>You will also see a <strong>Public external</strong> network.  We will use this now since you get a public IP address automatically.</p>

<h2 id="5-check-security-groups">5. Check security groups</h2>
<h4 id="include-an-ssh-security-group">Include an SSH security group</h4>
<p>The security group called <strong>default</strong> is selected already, and you should leave it like that.  It allows outgoing connections from your instance, and communication between your instances if you need more than one.</p>

<p>Nimbus projects are preconfigured with a security group to permit incoming SSH access.  This is required by most users.  The security group to add is named something like <strong>cou010-SSH</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="6-select-a-keypair">6. Select a keypair</h2>

<p><img src="../fig/Instance_keypairs.png" alt="Launch Keypairs" /></p>

<h2 id="7-click-on-launch-instance">7. Click on <strong>Launch Instance</strong></h2>

<h2 id="lets-go">Letâ€™s go!</h2>

<p>When you click <strong>Launch Instance</strong> you should see a new instance show up in your list (probably the only item you see listed).  You will see it change state as it starts up.</p>

<p><img src="../fig/Launch_instance_click.png" alt="Launch Instance Post Click" /></p>

<p>When complete, your entry should look like this:</p>

<h2 id="what-if-something-went-wrong">What if something went wrong?</h2>

<blockquote class="checklist">
  <h2 id="what-did-we-do">What did we do?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Selected an image and flavour</li>
    <li>Selected a network</li>
    <li>Selected a SSH security group</li>
  </ul>

</blockquote>

<p>What can go wrong?</p>
<ul>
  <li>If your instance does not start and gives an error message:  You might have selected the wrong network.</li>
</ul>
